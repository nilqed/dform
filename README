=========================================
FriCAS package: DifferentialForms (DFORM)
=========================================

Builds on domain DeRhamComplex, providing functions for computing volume forms,
Hodge star dual and interior product of a differential form with respect to a
(pseudo-) Riemannian metric. 

-------------
Documentation
-------------
The folder 'sphinx' contains the sphinx sources of the manual while the 
compiled HTML files are in 'docs/'. There is an online version served by 
GitHub pages (master branch /docs folder):
 
  -->  http://nilqed.github.io/dform/
  
Minimal documentation of DeRhamComplex can be found at 

  -->  http://kfp.bitbucket.org/fricas-derham/
  
or in the folder 'sphinx/derham'. 

-------------
Quick Install
-------------
If you have Quicklisp (https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) installed then follow
the steps below:

1. Add the following code to your '.fricas.input':

   )set mess type off
   quickLoad(p) ==
     systemCommand("lisp (load _"~/quicklisp/setup_")")
     systemCommand(concat ["lisp (ql::quickload _"",string p,"_")"])
   )set mess type on  

   Assuming your Quicklisp home is '~/quicklisp'. Otherwise adjust.
   
2. Clone https://github.com/nilqed/dform.git  to '~/quicklisp/local-projects' 

3. Start FriCAS and issue: quickLoad dform 
   *NOTE* If you start fricas without the '-nosman' option then you have to
          use ')frame next' in order to see the function 'quickLoad' (This
          is because .fricas.input is read into frame 'initial'.

The function 'quickLoad' will compile everything once (src) and when called next
time the binaries are loaded (lib). If you want to recompile the sources then
either delete everything in 'lib' or use ')lisp (compile-dform)'.   


-----------------------
Installing manually ...
-----------------------
Just compile the file dform.spad in 'src' :

 )compile dform
 
This will produce the following libs which have to be loaded manually:

 DFORM.NRLIB

-------
Testing
-------
There is a test file 'test_dform.input' in folder 'test' which can be run
either by the function 'testDFORM()$Lisp' when installed using Quicklisp
or manually by ')read test_dform' as usual. Note that a ')clear all' will be 
issued!

In the same folder there are some other examples and test files.
